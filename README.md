# SVMs-Explained-with-Scikit
Complete practical working of Svm explained and a Face Classification Task is performed using them 
The demo_working.ipynb file is a jupyter notebook which covers entire explanation of how a SVM works explained by creating a synthetic dataset.All concepts from coding,parameters,kernels,etc are all covered.
Face_Recognition_using_SVM.ipynb contains code of how a SVM with RBF kernel was used to perform face classification task on scikit's fetch_lfw_people dataset of faces of famous people.Many concepts such as Principal Component Analysis(PCA),GridSearch,advanced visualizations using seaborn are also included for a wholistic understanding.
